        <h2>Naruto Uzumaki: The Seventh Hokage</h2>
        <p><b>Naruto Uzumaki</b> (うずまきナルト, Uzumaki Naruto) is a <a href="#">shinobi</a> of <a
                href="#">Konohagakure's</a> <a href="#">Uzumaki</a> <a href="#">clan</a>. He became the <a
                href="#">jinchūriki</a> of
            the <a href="#">Nine-Tails</a> on the day of his birth — a fate that caused him to be shunned by most of <a
                href="#">Konoha</a> throughout his childhood. After joining <a href="#">Team Kakashi</a>, Naruto worked
            hard to gain the village's acknowledgement all the while chasing his dream to become <a href="#">Hokage</a>.
            In the following years, through many hardships and ordeals, he became a capable ninja, regarded as a
            hero both by the villagers, and soon after, the rest of the world, becoming known as the <b>Hero of the
                Hidden Leaf</b><i>(木ノ葉隠れの英雄, Konohagakure no Eiyū, literally meaning:</i> Hero of the Hidden Tree
            Leaves).
            He soon proved to be one of the main factors in winning the <a href="#">Fourth Shinobi World War</a>,
            leading him to achieve his dream and become the village's <b>Seventh Hokage</b><i>(七代目火影, Nanadaime Hokage,
                literally meaning: Seventh Fire Shadow)</i>.</p>

        <p style="padding-top: 10px;"><b>Background</b></p>
        <p style="margin: 0px;"> Naruto was born on the night of October 10th to <a href="#">Minato Namikaze</a> (the
            Fourth Hokage) and
            <a href="#">Kushina Uzumaki</a> (the second jinchūriki of the Nine-Tails). He was named after <a
                href="#">Naruto Musasabi,</a>
            the protagonist of <a href="#">Jiraiya's first book</a>, which made the <a href="#">Sannin</a> his
            godfather. The <a href="#">Third Hokage</a> made
            special arrangements for Minato to preserve Kushina's seal containing the Nine-Tails while she gave
            birth to Naruto in a remote location, assisted by midwives and <a href="#">Anbu</a>. A masked man, <a
                href="#">Tobi</a>, tracked down their
            location, however, killed the midwives and Anbu, and captured Naruto, forcing Minato to quickly
            rescue him and <a href="#">teleport</a> him to a safe house.
        </p>

        <p> With Minato gone, Tobi captured Kushina and released the Nine-Tails from her, using it to devastate
            <a href="#">Konoha</a>. Minato saved Kushina and left Naruto in her care before he went to protect the
            village,
            eventually defeating Tobi and freeing the Nine-Tails from Tobi's control. Returning to Naruto and Kushina's
            location, Minato realised the only way to stop the Nine-Tails was to seal it within Naruto, believing that
            his son would someday need the fox's power to defeat Tobi when he returned. Since the Nine-Tails' <a
                href="#">chakra</a>
            was too immense to be sealed into an infant, Minato <a href="#">sacrificed his soul</a> to split the fox's
            chakra in half,
            sealing the <a href="#">Yin</a> half within himself and the <a href="#">Yang</a> half within Naruto. After
            telling Naruto how much they
            loved him, Minato and Kushina succumbed to their wounds from protecting their son from the Nine-Tails and
            passed away.
        </p>

        <p>
            Orphaned, and not having anyone else to provide for him, Naruto received monthly income from the village in
            order to afford daily necessities. Naruto grew up not knowing who his parents were, receiving only his
            mother's surname, as Hiruzen wanted to protect Naruto from his father's enemies.[18] Minato's dying wish
            that Naruto be regarded as a hero was honoured by the very few who could put aside their pain and losses
            caused by the disaster, while the majority of Konoha, however having no knowledge of the circumstances
            surrounding his birth, openly ostracised and resented Naruto for containing the beast that devastated the
            village and took many lives; some even viewed Naruto as the Nine-Tails itself. Soon, the Third Hokage
            forbade anyone from mentioning the Nine-Tails, hoping that the younger generation would not blindly hate
            Naruto as their parents did.[19] However, Naruto's peers emulated their parents' hatred of him, despite not
            knowing why. This social isolation caused Naruto to crave acknowledgement, which he would gain by pulling
            pranks.

        <p style="padding-top: 10px ;"><b>Abilities</b></p>
        <img src="./Multiple_Shadow_Clone_Technique.png" alt="Image Unsupported" id="img3">
        <p><b>Shadow Clone Technique</b></p>
        <p>Naruto's first trademark technique was the <a href="#"></a>. While originally failing constantly with a
            basic illusionary clone, after briefly studying the <a href="#">Shadow Clone Technique</a>Scroll of Seals,
            he learned to create shadow clones on a
            mass scale. From then on, Naruto's skill with shadow clones blossomed to great heights. Having unusually
            high chakra reserves, Naruto could use this technique to create hundreds of shadow clones and retain large
            amounts of chakra in each one with relative ease. He could use them to outnumber or deceive his
            enemies, manoeuvre himself in mid-air, transform into weapons, scout areas, or test an opponent's
            abilities. During his elemental-affinity training, learning that the original will gain all the
            knowledge and conditioning of a shadow clone right after it dispersed. From this, Naruto can use his mass
            scale of clones to drastically speed up his training to gain years worth of experience in just days. By the
            time he became Hokage, Naruto's usage of this technique on mass-scale and prolonged-periods allowed him to
            constantly perform multiple simultaneous tasks throughout the village daily, although he does have a
            tendency to overexert himself, leaving him exhausted afterwards.</p>
        <p><b>Rasengan</b></p>
        <img src="./Naruto_Improving_Resengan.png" alt="Image Unsupported" id="img4">
        <p>Naruto's second trademark technique is the <a href="#">Rasengan</a>. Originally, due to his poor chakra control, Naruto had
            to use a shadow clone to form the spherical shape while he provided the chakra. Over time, Naruto developed
            larger versions of the Rasengan and learned how to perform it faster. During the Fourth Shinobi World
            War, he learned to use the Rasengan and its variants unaided with a single hand, or even form one in both
            hands simultaneously. He also increased the size of his standard Rasengan. Naruto had also shown
            the ability to release the Rasengan as an energy wave, or as a projectile in the anime. Using
            senjutsu or Kurama's chakra, Naruto can create more powerful and elaborate variations of the Rasengan; using
            the latter, he even developed the <a href="#">Super Mini-Tailed Beast Ball</a>, performing it in a similar manner to the
            Rasengan. In the anime, usage of his tailed beast chakra also allows him to instantly perform massive
            Rasengan without the aid of his hands and launch in quick successions, similar to a <a href="#">Tailed Beast Ball</a>.
        </p>
        <p>
            Naruto's natural affinity is <a href="#">Wind Release</a>. Using shadow clones, one to form the Rasengan while another
            infuses the Wind chakra, Naruto could complete difficult task of producing a Rasengan that is the pinnacle
            of shape and nature transformation, something no one before him could accomplish, including Kakashi and his
            father. Once adjusting to using the Wind Release: Rasengan he could expand upon it to produce the Wind
            Release: <a href="#">Rasenshuriken</a>. He also created different-sized variations, and could even use two Rasenshuriken
            simultaneously. Two years after its creation, he became skilled enough to form a Rasenshuriken without any
            shadow clones and throw it in his base form, a feat which he previously could only do while using his
            enhanced modes.

            After gaining the <a href="#">Six Paths Senjutsu</a>, Naruto can utilise all basic five nature transformations, as well as
            <a href="#">Yin-Yang Release</a>. He could make perfect use of the latter to revitalise life-forces, heal whomever he
            touches, and restore missing organs. After gaining chakra from the respective tailed beasts, Naruto can
            also use <a href="#">Shukaku's Magnet Release</a>, <a href="#">Son Gokū's Lava Release</a>, and <a href="#">Kokuō's Boil Release</a>, able to infuse any of
            the other elements into is normal techniques as seamlessly as with Wind chakra. Having an arm made from
            Hashirama's cells, Naruto has a possibility to use <a href="#">Wood Release</a>.
